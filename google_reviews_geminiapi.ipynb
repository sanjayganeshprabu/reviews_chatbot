            "🤖 Google's work environment is described as incredibly friendly, with helpful colleagues and managers who care about employees' career goals.  The environment is also catered to employee health, happiness, and wellness, with Google actively seeking employee input and implementing changes to improve their lives.  While some find the work can become boring for those not aiming for advancement, opportunities for mobility are considered accessible and well-defined.  One review mentions a dynamic and exciting environment, although another notes that Google can be inflexible in certain areas.\n",
            "You: hi\n",
            "🤖 hi\n",
            "You: how is the food in google\n",
            "🤖 Google provides free food during lunch, snacks, and drinks.  Multiple reviews mention the abundance of free food positively, although one review notes it's difficult to resist.\n",
            "You: how are my managers\n",
            "🤖 Reviews are mixed.  Some describe managers as having poor people skills, while others say that while managers aren't great, employees must manage themselves anyway.  One review mentions that a manager's perception of an employee's work and its relevance to their job impacts their ability to take on more responsibilities.  Another notes that administrative staff supporting multiple managers face conflicting expectations, with managers expecting more than initially communicated.  Finally, one review states that managers are not really good.\n",
            "You: what skills are required for this job?\n",
            "🤖 The provided reviews do not specify the required skills for the job.  They only mention that employees develop skills while working there and that coworkers are skilled and well-trained.\n",
            "You: how many hours should i work in a week\n",
            "🤖 Based on the reviews, there's no consensus on ideal weekly hours.  Some freelance positions required 35-40 hours per week, while other reviewers mention working \"long hours\" and weekends, and one even complained of \"short hours\".\n",
            "You: is the workload stressful?\n",
            "🤖 Based on the provided reviews, the workload at Google is described as \"very stressful at times,\" \"tough if you are not prepared for it,\" and \"very intense.\"  Therefore, yes, the workload is frequently described as stressful.\n",
            "You: what are the pros in google\n",
            "🤖 Based on the provided reviews, the pros of working at Google include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* Competitive salaries that attract and retain talent.\n",
            "*  Excellent perks, people, ambiance, and facilities.\n",
            "*  Working on interesting and challenging problems.\n",
            "* Great pay and perks.\n",
            "* Opportunity for career mobility and development.\n",
            "*  Being part of a company that is changing the world.\n",
            "*  Working with incredibly smart people.\n",
            "You: how are the employees\n",
            "🤖 Employee reviews describe Google employees as \"sharp\" and having \"good work ethics.\"  Multiple reviews praise management for recognizing and appreciating employee work.  One review states that the company treats employees \"as adults,\" describing the environment as \"open and caring.\"\n",
            "You: how is the management\n",
            "🤖 Reviews describe Google management as extremely hit-or-miss, particularly in middle management.  The process for becoming a manager appears to prioritize technical skills and interest over management skills, leading to managers who neglect people-management responsibilities in favor of technical tasks.  Employees often receive little guidance, especially new hires.  Senior management maintains a tight grasp on operations, making strategic operation difficult due to limited opportunities for high-level feedback.  While this \"sparse micromanagement\" is acknowledged as a problem,  senior managers are increasingly taking ownership of strategic initiatives, suggesting a potential shift in leadership culture.  One review mentions the \"intelligence of the management\" as a pro, but also notes a potential loss of understanding of goals and impact as the company grows.\n",
            "You: is there micromanagement\n",
            "🤖 The reviews indicate a general lack of micromanagement at Google.  Several reviews explicitly state \"no micromanagement\" or \"limited micromanagement\".\n",
            "You: is it stressful to work in google\n",
            "🤖 Based on the provided Google employee reviews, some employees find working at Google to be demanding and stressful,  leading some to leave for less stressful positions.  Several reviews mention overwork and excessive stress, particularly for those with families.  However, other reviews rate Google highly overall.\n",
            "You: how is it to work in google\n",
            "🤖 Working at Google is described as being at the cutting edge of technology and HR practices, with a strong emphasis on innovation and employee care.  Employees praise the opportunity to work with brilliant minds and a respectful culture.  However, some reviewers note that success requires initiative and self-ownership, and that the size of the company means navigating internal friction and politics is inevitable.  One reviewer even mentions that leaving Google might be difficult due to the positive experience.\n",
            "You: how is the career development\n",
            "🤖 Reviews are mixed regarding career development at Google.  Some employees report \"zero career growth\" and find it \"very hard to advance.\" Others state that Google \"really want[s] to develop career\" and see no need for change in this area.  A third review notes \"limited career growth opportunities\" in the long term.\n",
            "You: what are the cons in working for google\n",
            "🤖 Based on the provided reviews, no cons were reported.\n",
            "You: wait what are the disadvantages of working for google\n",
            "🤖 Based on the provided reviews, disadvantages of working at Google include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* Employees may not be sufficiently challenged by their roles and may be capable of more than their current responsibilities.  Employees need to proactively seek out projects and challenges.\n",
            "* Lack of retention; Google is a performance-driven company, and underperformers may be sidelined.\n",
            "* The job may not be as exciting as some might expect.\n",
            "You: do i need to be innovative to work here\n",
            "🤖 The reviews highlight innovation as a positive aspect of Google's culture (\"Constant innovation and change is part of the culture,\" \"Wonderful work environment that lends itself to great innovation\"). However,  they don't state that being innovative is a requirement for employment.\n",
            "You: what is the salary like\n",
            "🤖 The reviews describe Google salaries as good.\n",
            "You: what are some of the perks in google\n",
            "🤖 Based on the provided reviews, Google perks include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* Free food prepared on-site daily by professional chefs.\n",
            "* Free transportation to/from work from many employee residential areas.\n",
            "* On-site healthcare facilities.\n",

            "🤖 The provided text offers mixed reviews of working at Google.  Two reviews gave a 3-star rating, praising the Dublin office's amenities, international atmosphere, and social environment. However, these reviews noted that while good for a year or two, the job could become stressful and frustrating long-term.  Another review, a 5-star rating, simply stated that the reviewer loved their time at Google.  A recurring theme across the 3-star reviews was the change in company motto from \"don't be evil\" to \"do the right thing,\"  with the reviewer suggesting a decline in prioritizing users' interests.  Additionally, volunteering for tasks like interviewing was discouraged, as it was seen as detracting from performance scores.\n",
            "You: how many people gave good rating\n",
            "🤖 Four people gave a rating of 5.  One person gave a rating of 4.\n",
